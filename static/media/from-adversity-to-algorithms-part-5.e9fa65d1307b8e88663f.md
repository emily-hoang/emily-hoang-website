# Part 5 — From Adversity To Algorithms: The Journey Of Emily Hoang
## Chapter 5: Determination and Persistence

<br>With my coding skills at an intermediate level, I began searching aggressively for an entry-level role. However, landing that first job proved a struggle. I was prepared to fail. Many dismissed my self-taught qualifications and no-prior experience as insufficient. Rejection after rejection crushed my confidence but I couldn not give up.
<br>Then, one fateful day, a glimmer of hope emerged on the horizon. I attended a React workshop which was sponsored by Thoughtworks. During the workshop, I had the pleasure of meeting a genuine person who had organized the event. I shared with her my career goals and experience, and she was kind enough to take my details and refer me to HR for the graduate program that ThoughtWorks runs every year. I saw this as an opportunity to further sharpen my skills in a structured environment. I applied for the position with detailed information about my education, skills, and experience, and went on with 5 rounds of interviews. Each round tested my abilities and prospects in different areas. I prepared thoroughly for each stage of the interview process, researching the company, its values, and the specific role that I was applying for. ThoughtWorks values diversity and inclusivity, so showcasing my passion for technology and my alignment with their values was a strong asset in the interview process.
<br>A month later after the interview process was completed, a phone call finally came in from the ThoughtWorks HR department. As I listened to the HR representative at the other end of the line deliver the incredible news, a wave of euphoria washed over me. I could hardly contain my excitement when that long-awaited news finally arrived. It was a pivotal moment, one that marked the realization of a dream I had been working tirelessly toward.
<br>A wide smile stretched across my face, and my heart raced with exhilaration. I knew that this acceptance into the company’s graduate program was more than just an opportunity; it was a transformative step in my career change journey. The sheer happiness and gratitude I felt were indescribable. It was a moment that affirmed my dedication, hard work, and unwavering determination to carve a new path in my professional life.
<br>I couldn not help but immediately share the news with my husband — the one who was always there and supported me through the challenging time. When my family and friends knew, they each sent congratulatory messages which added to the overwhelming sense of achievement. This acceptance was more than just a job offer; it was a ticket to new horizons, a chance to learn and grow, and a confirmation that my aspirations were not only valid but within reach.
<br>The days following that phone call were filled with a sense of optimism and anticipation. I eagerly looked forward to the challenges and opportunities that lay ahead, knowing that this graduate program would be the cornerstone of my new exciting career change journey. The happiness I felt was a testament to my perseverance and the bright future that now beckoned with open arms.
<br>Exactly one week after that thrilling phone call, I found myself amidst a group of over 60 enthusiastic graduate candidates, all gathered for an immersive experience known as “ThoughtWorks University” in the vibrant city of Pune, India. Over the course of the next five weeks, my journey alongside these like-minded individuals turned out to be an educational odyssey that exceeded my initial expectations.
<br>Being surrounded by fellow participants who shared the same aspirations and ambitions was an invaluable aspect of the program. Together, we embarked on a collective quest for knowledge and growth, forging connections that transcended geographical and cultural boundaries.
<br>The program, designed meticulously by Thoughtworks, proved to be a treasure trove of insights and practical learning, especially for someone like myself who had no prior experience in the field.

<br>Each day was an opportunity to delve deeper into the world of technology, agile methodologies, and problem-solving. It was a holistic immersion, where both theoretical knowledge and hands-on experiences were seamlessly integrated.
<br>As I reflect upon those five transformative weeks, I can not help but feel a profound sense of gratitude for the opportunity that ThoughtWorks provided. It was more than just a stepping stone in my career change journey; it was a vibrant chapter in my life narrative, where I grew not only as a professional but also as an individual, equipped with newfound skills and a broader perspective.
<br>Back in Australia after this intensive program, I was excited to start contributing to projects. I thought I was ready for any challenges coming my way. However, juggling family duties and this new job really tested my dedication, but I persevered with grit. Late nights were spent balancing research and studying with caring for my daughter, who at 2 years old didn not quite understand my busy schedule. Still, her innocent smiles and hugs fuelled my energy each day.
<br>Finally, a month after, I stepped into my first role as a software engineer in a team with 5 others. This was a green field project so there was more than I expected to embrace as my first job. And so steep learning curves awaited. Long hours were spent understanding complex codebases, and different areas of software development. Impostor syndrome often crept in but holding onto my family encouragement kept self-doubt at bay.
<br>Slowly, I earned the respect of colleagues through diligent work. Positive feedback followed in due time, affirming I was on the right track.
<br>While the journey remained challenging, balancing the demands of work and family was undeniably hard. Yet, as the days turned into weeks and the weeks into months, a sense of stability and security gradually came within my grasp. It was a journey marked by resilience and unwavering determination.
<br>As I reached this significant milestone, the thought of sharing this hard-earned victory with my loved ones back home filled my heart with an overwhelming sense of pride. Their support and belief in me had been a constant source of motivation throughout this arduous endeavour. Their voices echoed in my mind, reminding me that I had indeed come a long way, surmounting obstacles and defying the odds.
<br>Every sleepless night, every sacrifice, and every uphill battle suddenly felt justified, for I was driven by a singular purpose — to provide a brighter and more promising future for my cherished little one. It was her well-being and the hope of offering her opportunities beyond what I had known that fueled my determination.
I<br>n those moments, I realized that this was merely the beginning of an exciting journey. The struggles I had endured had sculpted me into a stronger, more resilient individual, and I knew that even greater achievements and milestones lay ahead, waiting to be conquered. With unwavering resolve, I look forward to the promising chapters that awaited, ready to embrace the challenges and victories that were yet to come.

The path to a tech career may seem daunting, but it is not insurmountable. It is my sincerest hope that my story has served as a source of inspiration for those who dare to dream beyond their circumstances.
But it doesn not end here. It is only the beginning.

<br>I am driven by a new purpose, a greater calling — to pay forward the opportunities I have been blessed with.

<br>Through these initiatives, I aim to provide a nurturing environment where talent knows no socioeconomic boundaries. I want to empower underprivileged individuals with the skills, knowledge, and self-belief they need to embark on their own journeys in the world of technology. By breaking down the barriers that often hinder progress, we can unlock a world of possibilities for the next generation of innovators, creators, and change-makers.
