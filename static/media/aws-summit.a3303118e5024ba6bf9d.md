# AWS Summit Sydney 2024 — Exploring the Future of AI
I recently attended the AWS Summit in Sydney, where I had the opportunity to participate in various workshops, talks, and networking events with thousands of other cloud enthusiasts focused on the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) in today’s business world. In this blog post, I’m excited to share my key takeaways and experiences from the conference, highlighting how AI is transforming industries and creating new opportunities for innovation.

## Unveiling the Power of AI

<br>Day 1 of the AWS Summit Sydney super session keynotes offered a comprehensive overview of tools and technologies shaping the future using AI that are now available on AWS such as:
- Amazon Q, Amazon Q in Amazon Quicksight, and Amazon Q in Amazon Connect which are the applications that leverage FMs and LLMs.
- Amazon Bedrock with Guardrails, Agents, and Customisation Capabilities which are tools to build with FMs and LLMs
- GPUs, Tranium, Inferntia, SageMaker, UltraCluster, EFA, EC2 Capability Blocks, Nitro and Neuron which is the infrastructure for FM training & inference.
<br>The most exciting news was the launch of Amazon Bedrock in Australia, AWS's foundation model service. Although not all functionalities are available initially, Australian organizations and developers can now begin experimenting with generative AI models, particularly benefiting locally regulated industries that couldn't previously utilize international AWS regions.
<br>For those who are exploring and will consider using Amazon Bedrock, it provides managed access to foundation models, but you can also consider SageMaker as an alternative. It's always good to compare ongoing costs between the two. While Bedrock is excellent for quickly testing ideas, ensure you carefully model your costs before moving to production deployment as part of your pre-production planning.
<br>How companies are leveraging AWS to accelerate innovation across various domains
<br>One of the highlights of the conference was the opportunity to delve into real-world case studies showcasing the practical applications of AI. Companies like Leonardo.AI, SwimAus, and Atlassian provided compelling examples of how they're leveraging AI to address complex challenges and drive business growth. From predictive analytics to natural language processing, these case studies demonstrated the versatility and impact of AI across different domains.
