I still remember the days of my childhood in vivid detail.

<br>Growing up in a small village in Northern Vietnam, poverty was all I had ever known. My parents worked tirelessly to provide for our family. They worked long hours to ensure my siblings and I had enough food and a place to call home. Even with their relentless efforts, our family still struggled to make ends meet. And education was a luxury we could barely afford. I dreaded the thought of never being able to rise above the circumstances of my birth.
<br>From a young age, I was determined to change our situation. While my siblings were content helping around the house or working meagre jobs, I yearned for more. I knew the only way out of poverty was through education. There was a recurring scene in our household, etched in my memory like a vivid painting - my parents huddled together almost every day, their faces filled with concern, as they delved into discussions about how they could possibly cover the school fees for the upcoming semester. The weight of the financial struggles bore down heavily on my family, and it was a burden my parents shouldered with throughout my childhood.
<br>Amidst these discussions, a thought began to simmer and take shape in my mind, like the first embers of a fire. What if I pushed myself beyond the limits of my capabilities? What if I embarked on a relentless journey of diligent study and tireless effort to secure a scholarship that would ease the financial burdens weighing down on our struggling family?
<br>This thought was more than a mere glimmer of hope; it was a spark of inspiration that ignited a newfound purpose within me. With every passing day, it grew into a genuine determination that would fuel my relentless pursuit of academic excellence. The prospect of relieving my parents of the looming financial stress and securing a scholarship became a powerful driving force, propelling me forward on a path that promised not only personal growth but also the potential to bring about a positive transformation in our family's life.
<br>In the following weeks and years, I poured all my energy into my lessons. Late into the night, I studied by the dim light of a candle, brushing aside the growls of hunger in my belly and the relentless tug of sleep on my weary eyes.

<br>Slowly, my grades started improving. My teachers took notice of my persistence and unwavering commitment to learning. Over several years, I delved headfirst into extracurricular activities that allowed me to explore the realms of advanced mathematics, literature, and the intricacies of the English language. Enthusiastically, I joined teams dedicated to these fields, honing my skills through relentless practice and exploration of challenging concepts.
<br>As the school festival season approached, I eagerly added my name to the roster of every literacy and knowledge-based competition that graced the event. Days turned into weeks of diligent practice, pouring over books and seeking knowledge with an unquenchable thirst for learning. Through preparation and unwavering determination, I not only held my own but emerged victorious in numerous challenges. The taste of success was sweet, and it spurred me onward to further heights.
<br>Word of my accomplishments soon overreached the confines of the school walls, resonating throughout the district. A few months before my high school started, the provincial education department announced a program to support advanced learners from underprivileged backgrounds. A full scholarship was on offer to continue high school studies. I saw this as my chance to change the trajectory of my life. With encouragement from my teachers, I applied for the coveted spot. The interview process was draining but I gave it my all. When the results were announced, I could not believe my eyes - my name was at the top of the list. Thrilled, I rushed home to share the good news with my family. My parents' faces lit up as I spoke, their eyes reflecting both joy and pride. It was one of those rare moments when the weight of struggle was lifted off their shoulders. As this opportunity unfolded, a dream sparked in my mind, driven by the hope that this turning point might just light up not only my life but the lives of my whole family.
<br>Yet, like a bittersweet melody, the chords of reality played a note that resounded deeply within. While my spirit was willing and my aspirations high, the symphony of circumstances did not harmonize. Accommodation, transportation, food, fees – these elements of a dream's foundation were woven with threads of challenges too complex to untangle. My parents, whose eyes had gleamed with pride just moments before, were now touched with a different kind of emotion – an ache borne out of their inability to provide the support I needed for studying in a boarding school.
<br>In a moment that felt like a gust extinguishing a candle's flame, I realized that I had to make a heart-wrenching decision. The scholarship that held so much promise had conditions I couldn't fulfil without my family's support. The bitter truth stared me in the face: I had to relinquish the scholarship, a beacon of hope that had illuminated my path, now dimmed.
<br>With that choice, a storm of emotions engulfed me. Disappointment, sadness, and a sense of loss – they mingled within, threatening to overwhelm. It was a crossroad that could have halted my journey before it even began. But deep within the tempest, a spark of resilience flickered.

<br>The road ahead was no longer paved with the certainty of that scholarship, but it was still a road, waiting for my footsteps to mark it. The path was uncertain, riddled with challenges and steep climbs. But that uncertainty, that uphill struggle — they would not deter me. If anything, they fueled the fire within, stoking my determination to rise above the circumstances that sought to bind me.
